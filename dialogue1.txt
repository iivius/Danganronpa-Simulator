I didn't do it!
I swear I didn't do it.
I can't believe they were killed...
I couldn't have done it!
I have a solid alibi!
I was friends with them, why would I do it?
I can't believe this is happening...
Fine, vote for me. It's not me though.
This discussion isn't going anywhere.
What?! There's no way I would do it.
It's not me, please!
