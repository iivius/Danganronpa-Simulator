by pushing them off a cliff
by stabbing them with a knife
by stabbing them with a sword
by shooting them with a gun
by shooting them with a crossbow
by hanging them
by setting them on fire
by choking them
by drowning them
by knocking them out with a hammer
by knocking them out with a bat
by poisoning their dinner
by feeding them to wolves
by destroying a building they were in
by setting off poisonous gas in their room
by trapping them underground
by pushing them into lava
by pushing them into the freezing sea
by feeding them to a carnivorous plant
by blasting out their eardrums
by beating them in a fight
by hitting them with a bowling ball
by drowning them in the swamp
by blowing them up with a bomb
by electrocuting them
by running them over
by suffocating them in their sleep
by poisoning them with a dart
by choking them with a chain
by freezing them
by exposing them to a virus
by overdosing them on drugs
